# Vehicle Number Plate Detection and Recognition

## Introduction
This project aims to detect and recognize vehicle number plates using OpenCV for image processing and Tesseract for Optical Character Recognition (OCR). This application can be used for various purposes including automated toll collection, traffic management, and security.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following libraries installed:
- `numpy`
- `OpenCV`
- `matplotlib`
- `tensorflow`
- `pandas`
- `pytesseract`
- Tesseract OCR engine [(https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract)](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki)
